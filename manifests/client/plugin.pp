# This defined type distributes .
#
# Parameters:
# * $plugin_name = What Puppet knows this plugin resource as. This is used to create the 
#                  filenameon the client machine in the file resource. By default, it's

# * $nrpe_plugin_liddir = The directory where the NRPE plugins themselves live
#
# * $source_file = The file that will get distributed to Icinga client machines. This can

#                  for more info on what formats of URLs you can use to specify which files
#                  you want to distribute.
